Node.js for Mobile Apps - Module compatibility issues
====================================

The purpose of this repository is to track and discuss compatibility issues of public npm modules with [Node.js for Mobile Apps](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile). Only issues regarding modules found on npm should be opened here. For modules that are included in the core library or the React Native / Cordova plugins, please open an issue in the [main project repo](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile).

Given the large number of modules in the npm registry, this is intended to be an effort driven primarily by the developer community. 

While this repo can be useful for preliminary discussion and investigation of incompatibilites, opening issues and submitting fixes to the modules' projects is also encouraged. Links to module-specific resources can be found on each module's npm page.
